# Week 3: Journal

- Title ideas
  - Let's do the Map Warp Againnn!

- Whole week was a bit of a fail tbh

- Battle with technology
  - HDR pictures == laptop very mad if more than one pic is open
  - I know! Let's use the computer I just built --> Adobe hates Linux
  - Wifi chip will not connect --> but then it did??? (hint: it did not, just faked it)
  - Canada Computers was out of the ethernet cables I could use
  - Stay tuned for "Will Chantal ever get her Pinhey's Point data online or are they doomed to forever sit on her computer?"
- Would like to find map of cemetery to overlay, perhaps add more information
- Excited to do spatial archaeology activity --> feel like it will put this into greater context


Are there differences in who gets commemorated, and how?


Were there aspects of the work that affected you emotionally? Why?


Do the 3d models have an affective aura? Why or why not?


In what ways does mapping the graveyard give you authority and power?
